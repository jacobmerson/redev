 * The Rendezvous Algorithm
 * ========================
 *
 * The Rendezvous algorithm
 * > enables scalable algorithms which are most useful when processors neither
 * know which other processors > to send data to, nor which other processors
 * will be sending data to them [1]. It is used in LAMMPS [1], the PUMI
 * unstructured mesh library for loading multi-billion element meshes from file
 * [2,3], and in the Data Transfer Toolkit [4].
 *
 * The following figures from [1] depict two unstructured meshes of the same
 * domain where information from one mesh is needed by the other but they have a
 * different partitioning across the same set of processes.
 * In Figure 4 the colored ovals depict the domain owned by a given process in
 * the two meshes.
 * Since the domains are not intersecting the Rendezvous method is used to
 * efficiently exchange data between the processes that do have the intersecting
 * portion of the domain.
 * A common domain partition, depicted by the red structured grid in the bottom
 * two figures, allows processes that own data within a given cell in grid to
 * 'rendezvous' with the other processes that own data in that cell and perform
 * an exchange.
 *

 *
 * The key to the Rendezvous algorithm is a partitioning of the common portion
 * of the domain that (1) has a relatively low memory usage and (2) supports
 * computationally efficient queries for membership within the partition given a
 * entity within the domain (e.g., a mesh element or vertex). The structured
 * grid from the above figure is one possible partition that satisfies these
 * requirements.
 *
 * WDMApp Use Case
 * ===============
 *
 * The [WDMApp project](https://wdmapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) combines an
 * application that evolves the physics near the 'edge' of a fusion device
 * (i.e., D3D, ITER, etc.) with another application that
 * is responsible for the inner 'core' portion of the device near the
 * magnetic axis.
 *
 * The following figure depicts a conceptual division of the D3D domain into
 * core and edge sub-domains where the respective applications are
 * operating and an overlap sub-domain where fields on the mesh are exchanged
 * and transformed.
 *
 * \image xml overlap500.png
 *
 * The WDMApp Coupler is a set of procedures to support field transformations in
 * the overlap sub-domain between application meshes and partitions that are
 * different.
 * For example, the following figure depicts a 16 process partition created with
 * a geometric recursive bisection method on the left and a four process
 * partition using groupings of geometric model faces.
 * The Rendezvous algorithm allows the WDMApp Coupler to define its own
 * partition of the domain and efficiently collect, and transform, field data
 * from the core and edge applications.

 *
 * Redev Design
 * ============
 *
 * Redev is an implementation of the Rendezvous algorithm that is currently
 * focused on supporting the WDMApp Coupler and its use of independent sets of
 * MPI processes for the core and edge applications.
 * Specifically, each of these applications is executed with its own `mpirun`
 * (or equivalent batch scheduler) command. Transferring data between these sets
 * of processes is directly supported by the
 * [ADIOS2](https://adios2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.
 *
 * Key to the Redev design is the concept of a Server and Clients.
 * A Client is a set of processes that owns some portion of the overlap
 * sub-domain and needs to exchange data in that domain with another Client.
 * Clients query the Redev API to (1) determine which processes in the Server
 * the data they own needs to be sent, (2) send the data, and (3) receive data
 * back from the server in their portion of the domain. The Server is a set of
 * processes that owns the Rendezvous partition of the overlap sub-domain,
 * receives data from Clients, and supports sending the data back to the
 * Clients.
 *
 * The following figure depicts an example Redev workflow for exchanging data
 * between two applications (Clients) and the Coupler (the Server). The
 * Rendezvous partition in this example is formed from groups of adjacent
 * geometric model entities referred to as a 'Feature-based PartitionInterface'.
 * Red colored boxes and text are operations supported by Redev.
 * The phases of the workflow are described below.
 * - _App. Setup_: The applications initialize its domain data
 *   by loading meshes, and associated partition data.
 *   The Coupler loads the geometric model of the domain.
 * - _Rdv. Setup_: The coupler forms the 'Feature-based PartitionInterface' used
 * for Rendezvous, and sends partition information to an instance of Redev
 * embedded into each application.
 * - _Mesh Setup_: Each application queries the rendezvous partition in a loop
 *   over their mesh entities in the overlap sub-domain and create a map of mesh
 *   entities to their destination rank in the Coupler.
 *   Using a communication object established for the connection between
 *   each application and the Coupler a **Forward** send is performed from the
 *   applications to the Coupler.
 *   This initial **Forward** send, and the meta data associated with it that
 *   describes which application rank sent each portion of the data, enables the
 *   construction of a **Reverse** send from the Coupler back to the appropriate
 *   application processes.
 * - _Field Transfer_: The **Forward** and **Reverse** sends are
 *   repeatedly executed until the coupled simulation completes.
 *   The figure depicts one of portion of a communication round that performs
 *   a **Forward** send from application 'A' to the Coupler,
 *   execution of a field transformation procedure marked 'mesh-to-mesh', and a
 *   **Reverse** send from the Coupler to application 'B'.
 *   The communication round would be completed with the mirror image of this
 *   process; a **Forward** send from 'B' to the Coupler, another
 * transformation, and a **Reverse** send from the Coupler to 'A'.
